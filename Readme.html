<h1>Javassist version 3</h1>

<h3>Copyright (C) 1999-2015 by Shigeru Chiba, All rights reserved.</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p>Javassist (JAVA programming ASSISTant) makes Java bytecode manipulation
simple.  It is a class library for editing bytecodes in Java;
it enables Java programs to define a new class at runtime and to
modify a class file when the JVM loads it.  Unlike other similar
bytecode editors, Javassist provides two levels of API: source level
and bytecode level.  If the users use the source-level API, they can
edit a class file without knowledge of the specifications of the Java
bytecode.  The whole API is designed with only the vocabulary of the
Java language.  You can even specify inserted bytecode in the form of
source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly.  On the other hand, the
bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file as
other editors.

<p><br>

<h2>How to run sample programs</h2>

<p>JDK 1.4 or later is needed.

<h3>0. If you have Apache Ant</h3>

<p>Run the sample-all task.
Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

<h3>1. Move to the directory where this Readme.html file is located.</h3>

<p>In the following instructions, we assume that the javassist.jar
file is included in the class path.
For example, the javac and java commands must receive
the following <code>classpath</code> option:

<ul><pre>
-classpath ".:javassist.jar"
</pre></ul>

<p>If the operating system is Windows, the path
separator must be not <code>:</code> (colon) but
<code>;</code> (semicolon).  The java command can receive
the <code>-cp</code> option
as well as <code>-classpath</code>.

<p>If you don't want to use the class-path option, you can make
<code>javassist.jar</code> included in the <code>CLASSPATH</code>
environment:

<ul><pre>
export CLASSPATH=.:javassist.jar
</pre></ul>

<p>or if the operating system is Windows:

<ul><pre>
set CLASSPATH=.;javassist.jar
</pre></ul>


<p>Otherwise, you can copy <tt>javassist.jar</tt> to the directory

<ul>&lt;<i>java-home</i>&gt;<tt>/jre/lib/ext</tt>.</ul>

<p>&lt;<i>java-home</i>&gt; depends on the system.  It is usually
<tt>/usr/local/java</tt>, <tt>c:\j2sdk1.4\</tt>, etc.

<h3>2. sample/Test.java</h3>

<p>   This is a very simple program using Javassist.

<p>   To run, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% javac sample/Test.java
% java sample.Test
</pre></ul>

<p>   For more details, see <a type="text/plain" href="sample/Test.java">sample/Test.java</a>

<h3>3. sample/reflect/*.java</h3>

<p>   This is the "verbose metaobject" example well known in reflective
   programming.  This program dynamically attaches a metaobject to
   a Person object.  The metaobject prints a message if a method
   is called on the Person object.

<p>   To run, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% javac sample/reflect/*.java
% java javassist.tools.reflect.Loader sample.reflect.Main Joe
</pre></ul>

<p>Compare this result with that of the regular execution without reflection:

<ul><pre>% java sample.reflect.Person Joe</pre></ul>

<p>   For more details, see <a type="text/plain" href="sample/reflect/Main.java">sample/reflect/Main.java</a>

<p>   Furthermore, the Person class can be statically modified so that
   all the Person objects become reflective without sample.reflect.Main.
   To do this, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% java javassist.tools.reflect.Compiler sample.reflect.Person -m sample.reflect.VerboseMetaobj
</pre></ul>

<p>   Then,
<ul><pre>
% java sample.reflect.Person Joe
</pre></ul>

<h3>4. sample/duplicate/*.java</h3>

<p>   This is another example of reflective programming.

<p>   To run, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% javac sample/duplicate/*.java
% java sample.duplicate.Main
</pre></ul>

<p>Compare this result with that of the regular execution without reflection:

<ul><pre>% java sample.duplicate.Viewer</pre></ul>

<p>For more details, see
<a type="text/plain" href="sample/duplicate/Main.java">sample/duplicate/Main.java</a>

<h3>5. sample/vector/*.java</h3>

<p>This example shows the use of Javassit for producing a class representing
a vector of a given type at compile time.

<p>   To run, type the commands:
<ul><pre>
% javac sample/vector/*.java
% java sample.preproc.Compiler sample/vector/Test.j
% javac sample/vector/Test.java
% java sample.vector.Test
</pre></ul>

<p>Note: <code>javassist.jar</code> is unnecessary to compile and execute
<code>sample/vector/Test.java</code>.

For more details, see
<a type="text/plain" href="sample/vector/Test.j">sample/vector/Test.j</a>
and <a type="text/plain" href="sample/vector/VectorAssistant.java">sample/vector/VectorAssistant.java</a>

<h3>6. sample/rmi/*.java</h3>

<p>   This demonstrates the javassist.rmi package.

<p>   To run, type the commands:
<ul><pre>
% javac sample/rmi/*.java
% java sample.rmi.Counter 5001
</pre></ul>

<p>   The second line starts a web server listening to port 5001.

<p>   Then, open <a href="sample/rmi/webdemo.html">sample/rmi/webdemo.html</a>
with a web browser running
   on the local host.  (<tt>webdemo.html</tt> trys to fetch an applet from
   <tt>http://localhost:5001/</tt>, which is the web server we started above.)

<p>   Otherwise, run sample.rmi.CountApplet as an application:

<ul><pre>
% java javassist.web.Viewer localhost 5001 sample.rmi.CountApplet
</pre></ul>

<h3>7. sample/evolve/*.java</h3>

<p>   This is a demonstration of the class evolution mechanism implemented
   with Javassist.  This mechanism enables a Java program to reload an
   existing class file under some restriction.

<p>   To run, type the commands:
<ul><pre>
% javac sample/evolve/*.java
% java sample.evolve.DemoLoader 5003
</pre></ul>

<p>   The second line starts a class loader DemoLoader, which runs a web
   server DemoServer listening to port 5003.

<p>   Then, open <a href="http://localhost:5003/demo.html">http://localhost:5003/demo.html</a> with a web browser running
   on the local host.
(Or, see <a href="sample/evolve/start.html">sample/evolve/start.html</a>.)

<h3>8. sample/hotswap/*.java</h3>

<p>This shows dynamic class reloading by the JPDA.  It needs JDK 1.4 or later.
To run, first type the following commands:

<ul><pre>
% cd sample/hotswap
% javac *.java
% cd logging
% javac *.java
% cd ..
</pre></ul>

<p>If your Java is 1.4, then type:

<ul><pre>
% java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000 Test
</pre></ul>

<p>If you are using Java 5, then type:

<ul><pre>
% java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000 Test
</pre></ul>

<p>Note that the class path must include <code>JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar</code>.

<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>To know the version number, type this command:

<ul><pre>
% java -jar javassist.jar
</pre></ul>

<p>Javassist provides a class file viewer for debugging.  For more details,
see javassist.Dump.

<p>-version 3.6.0 on September 13, 2007

<p>-version 3.6.0.CR1 on July 27, 2007

<ul>
    <li>The stack map table introduced since Java 6 has been supported.
    <li>CtClass#getDeclaredBehaviors() now returns a class initializer
        as well as methods and constructors.
    <li>The default status of automatic pruning was made off.
        Instead of pruning, this version of Javassist compresses
        the data structure of a class file after toBytecode() is called.
        The compressed class file is automatically decompressed when needed.
        This saves memory space better than pruning.
    <li><a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JASSIST-33">JIRA JASSIST-33</a> has been fixed.
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>javassist.tool.Dump was added.  It is a class file viewer.

  <li>javassist.FiledInitializer.byNewArray() was added.  It is for
    initializing a field with an array object.

  <li>javassist.CodeConverter.redirectMethodCall() was added.

  <li>javassist.Run was added.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.7
<ul>
  <li>javassit.Loader was largely modified.  javassist.UserLoader was
    deleted.  Instead, Codebase was renamed to ClassPath
    and UserClassPath was added.  Now programmers who want to
    customize Loader must write a class implementing UserClassPath
    instead of UserLoader.  This change is for sharing class search paths
    between Loader and CtClass.CtClass(String).

  <li>CtClass.addField(), addMethod(), addConstructor(), addWrapper() were
    also largely modified so that it receives CtNewMethod, CtNewConstructor,
    or CtNewField.  The static methods for creating these objects were
    added to the API.

  <li>Constructors are now represented by CtConstructor objects.
    CtConstructor is a subclass of CtMethod.

  <li>CtClass.getUserAttribute() was removed.  Use CtClass.getAttribute().

  <li>javassist.rmi.RmiLoader was added.

  <li>javassist.reflect.Metalevel._setMetaobject() was added.  Now
    metaobjects can be replaced at runtime.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.6
<ul>
  <li>Javassist was modified to correctly deal with array types appearing
    in signatures.

  <li>A bug crashed resulting bytecode if a class includes a private static
    filed.  It has been fixed.

  <li>javassist.CtNewInterface was added.

  <li>javassist.Loader.recordClass() was renamed into makeClass().

  <li>javassist.UserLoader.loadClass() was changed to take the second
    parameter.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.5
<ul>
  <li>a bug-fix version.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.4
<ul>
  <li>Major update again.  Many classes and methods were changed.
    Most of methods taking java.lang.Class have been changed to
    take javassist.CtClass.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.3
<ul>
  <li>Major update.  Many classes and methods were changed.
</ul>
